### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Physicist that used to specialized in magnetosphere physics, a field in space sciences/astronomy. Now, I look to other projects in the form of machine learning, simulations, and even video game development!

Here are some of my projects:

### Course Projects - interesting projects completed for a class in my academic studies
- [Monte Carlo Simulations for Electron Ionization in the Atmosphere](https://github.com/mandomal-coursework/monte-carlo-final-project) - An interesting statistical modeling project that demonstrates some interesting properties of the atmosphere, starting with a few simple rules!

### Gamejam Games - competitions of various lengths and requirements:
- [Frost Thee](https://pozitronic.itch.io/frost-thee) - 2nd Place - Our first game jam! Christmas theme top-down shooter. Save Santa and Christmas as a heroic snowman!
- [Orbital Mechanic](https://alephlol.itch.io/orbital-mechanic) - 1st Place - A curvilinear platformer where you fix handsome satellites!
